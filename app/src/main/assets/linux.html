    <p style="color:green">Most Used Linux Command List<p>

    <p>There are a countless number of commands in Linux. We are bound to use a number of them on a daily routine or numerous times to perform common tasks than others. It is important to note that certain commands are “distro-based” &#8211; they can only be found in specific distros. While others are generic Unix/Linux commands that you’ll find in all if not most mainstream distros.</p>
    <p>In this article, we will introduce you a list of most frequently used Linux commands with their examples for easy learning. You can find the actual description of each Linux command in their manual page which you can access like this:</p>
    <pre><div>$ man command-name
</div></pre>
    <h3>adduser/addgroup Command</h3>
    <p>The <strong>adduser</strong> and <strong>addgroup</strong> commands are used to add a user and group to the system respectively according to the default configuration specified in <strong>/etc/adduser.conf</strong> file.</p>
    <pre><div>$ sudo adduser tecmint
</div></pre>

    <h3>agetty Command</h3>
    <p><strong>agetty</strong> is a program which manages physical or virtual terminals and is invoked by <strong>init</strong>. Once it detects a connection, it opens a tty port, asks for a user’s login name and calls up the <strong>/bin/login</strong> command. <strong>Agetty</strong> is a substitute of Linux <strong>getty</strong>:</p>
    <pre><div>$ agetty -L 9600 ttyS1 vt100

    <h3>alias Command</h3>
    <p><strong>alias</strong> is a useful shell built-in command for creating aliases (shortcut) to a Linux command on a system. It is helpful for creating new/custom commands from existing Shell/Linux commands (including options):</p>
    <pre><div>$ alias home='cd /home/tecmint/public_html'
</div></pre>
    <p>The above command will create an alias called <strong>home</strong> for <strong>/home/tecmint/public_html</strong> directory, so whenever you type <strong>home</strong> in the terminal prompt, it will put you in the <strong>/home/tecmint/public_html</strong> directory.</p>
